# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION-
In this project, I have used various natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify fake news articles using sci-kit libraries from python.

You will see that newly created dataset has only 2 classes as compared to 6 from original classes. Below is method used for reducing the number of classes.

Original -- New
True -- True
Mostly-true -- True
Half-true -- True
Barely-true -- False
False -- False
Pants-fire -- False

Below are the columns used to create 3 datasets that have been in used in this project

Column 1: Statement (News headline or text).
Column 2: Label (Label class contains: True, False)
